# crossing

The aim of that puzzle is to implement a TrafficLightsSystem
Using traffic lights will prevent two cars from different directions to crush.
The code will be implemented in com.egencia.puzzle.crossing.infra.client.TrafficLightsSystem

## How to run the simulation :
1. Run the CrossingApplication
2. Run the TrafficLightsSystem
3. Run the CarInjector
4. Open the browser at http://localhost:8080

## How to run in manual control :
1. Run the CrossingApplication
2. Run the CarSender
3. Open the browser at http://localhost:8080
4. Open a small browser window at http://localhost:8080/sendCars.html
5. Open a small browser window at http://localhost:8080/changeTrafficLight.html

In case of cars stuck on the road : ClearTraffic
